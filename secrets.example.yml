# If you are using a Mac, you may need to install a CA bundle to enable SSL
# communication with the DigitalOcean API. It is recommended to first install
# Homebrew. With Homebrew installed, run the following command to install the
# bundle:
#
# $ brew install curl-ca-bundle
#
# This should install the bundle to
# /usr/local/opt/curl-ca-bundle/share/ca-bundle.crt
# 
# If your bundle lives somewhere else, you can override the location here.
